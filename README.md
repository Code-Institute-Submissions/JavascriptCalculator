## Milestone Project 2

### Purpose
This Website was created for the sole purpose of completing the second Milestone Project for the Code Institute's Full Stack Developer course. It was built using the knowledge gained from the HTML, CSS and Javascript Modules.

The target audience for this product is users looking to use a Calculator online from the user's web browser, alternatively, other developers can use the site to learn and use the code.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## User Experience Design

### First Time Visitor Goals

- To easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the Tool.
- To be able to easily navigate throughout the site.
- To view the website and content clearly on my mobile device.
- To use a web-based calculator.

### Returning User Goals

- To use the tool on-going when needing to use basic mathematics or demonstrate the power of javascript.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## -Design-

A single page based website allowing the user to navigate the tool and use the site exactly as it was intended for.

Color - The Color scheme was used to keep the focus on the center focus point of the website, allowing the Calculator itself to stand out above any other element on the page.

Typography - The Font used in this project is the standard web browser "sans-serif" this is to keep the page clean and usable across all devices due to the readability of the calculator buttons, it does not require additional font.

Background - Keeping to the theme of a clean website that doesn't draw your attention from the calculator i used [Color Hunt](https://colorhunt.co/palette/334257476072548ca8eeeeee) to control a color scheme that fits nicely together and making sure the bright colors stayed within the calculator. This website was not designed to be fancy but rather effective and without distractions.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## -Website Goals-

* To demonstrate a simple yet effective Javascript web-based Calculator.

## -Target Audience-

* Users looking to use a web-based calculator.
* Users looking to learn or share a basic understanding of how Javascript can work for you in the web browser.

## -User Goals-

* Quick Mathematics.
* Learn how to create a Javascript Calculator.
* To share ideas with other students.

Not all users who come across this website will be needing to use it or even visit again, but its intended use is to be available as a tool.

#### -Main Section-
The Main section is the focal point of the entire webpage where we have the full calculator made up of a viewer window, operator buttons and numbers buttons.

#### -Viewer / Result Window-
The Viewer / Result window is where your calculated results will appear.

#### -Instructions Button-
The instructions button display a pop up on click providing full instructions to the user on how to use the calculator.

#### -The Footer-
The footer displays a Github icon which on click will take you to TechCentreUK Github profile in a new tab. Upon hover, you will notice the color change to show its interactable.

Also in the footer is a donation button that takes you to a PayPal donation page in a new tab. This button also zooms in by 150% on hover to show its interactable.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## -Future Features-

Add more operators with functionality.

Add more Javascript-based tools across multiple pages.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## -Testing-

The web page has been tested to the best of my immediate ability.

Once testing was complete and I was satisfied with the result I used validators to ensure my code was up to standard,
I did this using W3C validator for HTML, Jigsaw Validator for CSS and Javascript using Esprima.

The Javascript Validator shows an errors but it is indeed correct, the Validator doesn't test the HTML for instructionsAlert so throws an error saying it has not been called.

Testing has been done on at least three web browsers and all screen sizes down to 320px wide.

All links to external websites open in a new browser.

All links show a difference in Color when you hover over the link.

All images are responsive and nothing has been hidden.

### Lighthouse - Dev Tools
![Lighthouse]()
\
I used lighthouse in dev tools to test the website in many ways, for example, I had to test my text colors contrast and adjust accordingly.
As you can see by the above screenshot I used this to improve the websites overall performance.

### Chrome Dev Tools and Responsive Mode
Chrome Dev Tools played a huge role in my testing on a day to day basis, I was able to edit my CSS in real-time to confirm the code I'm writing had to correct output as I was coding. It mostly helped when Styling for responsive mode.

Another huge part of Chrome DevTools was using the built-in console to test if my code was correctly working before it could visually show me on the web page which I believe to be the biggest challenge during this module.

### Links
I tested for links leading to external websites I used the target _blank attribute to open a new tab so the user does not lose place on our website.

### Browsers
I Tested compatibility across browsers by using Safari, Chrome and iOS Safari. As an extra measure, I also tested browser compatibility across more browsers using the plugin [User-Agent Switcher](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-agent-switcher-for-c/djflhoibgkdhkhhcedjiklpkjnoahfmg).

## -Deployment-

### Creating My Website
To create this project I used the Code Institute Gitpod Full Template by navigating [here](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) and clicking the button labelled 'Use this template'.

Next, I was directed to the 'create new repository from template page' and entered in my repo name, then I clicked create a repository from template button.

The commands used for commits throughout the project:

git add filename - This command was used to add files to the staging area before committing.
git commit -m "commit message explaining the updates" - This command was used to commit changes to the local repository.
git push - This command is used to push all committed changes to the GitHub repository.

### -Git Hub Pages-

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository

2. At the top of the Repository (NOT at the top of the page), locate the "Settings" button on the menu.

3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.

4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".

5. Click Save and the page will automatically refresh.

6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site link in the "GitHub Pages" section. Alternatively, click this [Link](https://techcentreuk.github.io/JavascriptCalculator/)

### Forking
Forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea. - This is the definition from Github Docs.

1. Navigate to the GitHub Repository you want to fork.

2. On the top right of the page under the header, click the fork button.

3. Fork

4. This will create a duplicate of the full project in your GitHub Repository.

### Clone

1. Navigate to the Github Repository you want to clone.

2. Click the drop-down menu labelled "Clone".

3. Either Download the ZIP file, unpackage locally and open with IDE (This route ends here) OR Copy Git URL from the HTTPS dialogue box.

4. Open your development editor and open a terminal window in a directory of your choice.

5. Use the 'git clone' command in the terminal followed by the copied git URL.

6. A clone of the project will be created locally on your local machine.
